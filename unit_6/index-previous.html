	<h3>Design + Creative Writing</h3>
	<p id="smallcaps">People's stories are amazing. Many we read about in the news, but many are hidden and we don't read about them. People are rising above fear and insecurity to achieve their dreams, others are stories of success because of the support and love they have around them, while others are suffering and overcoming great odds. We like capturing these inspirational stories using our expertise in writing and design. We use our skills to tell these beautiful stories to the world.<p>
